# Secure JWT Authentication and Password Hashing

Welcome to our GitHub repository where we implement secure authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and password hashing techniques. Our code ensures robust security measures to protect user credentials and sensitive information. 

## Features

- **JWT Authentication**: Implement a secure login mechanism using JSON Web Tokens.
- **Password Hashing**: Securely store passwords in the database using robust hashing algorithms.
- **SQL Database Integration**: Demonstrate secure storage and retrieval of hashed passwords from an SQL database.
- **Comparison of Hashed Passwords**: Compare hashed passwords for secure authentication.
- **Documentation and Usage Guide**: Detailed documentation and usage guidelines provided for seamless integration.

## Usage
